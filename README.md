# STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
# Overview:
The Student Grade Calculator is a Java project developed using the NetBeans IDE 17 that enables students to calculate their overall grades based on marks obtained in various subjects. The application provides a user-friendly interface for inputting subject marks, computing total marks, calculating average percentages, determining grades, and displaying the results.

# Features:

* **Subject-wise Input:** The application allows the user to input marks for each subject on a scale of 0 to 100.
* **Total Marks Calculation:** The program computes the total marks by summing up the marks obtained in all entered subjects.
* **Average Percentage Calculation:** The average percentage is calculated by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
* **Grade Assignment:** Based on the average percentage achieved, the program assigns a corresponding grade (A, B, C, D, or F).
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The project provides an interactive console interface, making it easy for users to input data and view results.
* **Loop for Multiple Calculations:** The application includes a loop that allows users to perform multiple grade calculations without restarting the program.

# Technologies Used:
* **Java:** Core programming language used for the development of the application.
* **NetBeans IDE 17:** Integrated Development Environment used for coding, testing, and debugging the project.

# How to Run the Project:

Open the project in NetBeans IDE 17.
Build and compile the project to ensure there are no errors.
Run the project, and the console interface will prompt the user to input subject marks.
Follow the on-screen instructions to input marks and view the calculated results.
The program will ask if the user wants to perform another calculation. Enter 'yes' to continue or 'no' to exit.
